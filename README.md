# Compiler
Coursework for [compiler class](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/soe-ycscs1-compilers) at Stanford

Study major ideas in the implementation of programming language compilers, including:
- lexical analysis
- parsing, abstract syntax tree
- types and type checking
- intermediate languages
- dataflow analysis
- code optimization
- code generation

## Project
Write a complete compiler for **COOL**, the Classroom Object Oriented Language
- COOL has the essential features of a realistic programming language.
- Small and simple enough that it can be implemented in a few thousand lines of code.
- Project is implemented in C++ 

## Setup
Instruction for installing COOL compiler can be found [here](./setup/README.md)
